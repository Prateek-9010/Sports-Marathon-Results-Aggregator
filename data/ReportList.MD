List of reports
1	Distribution of finishers in each distance by age
	For eg in Marathon , we can have upto 3:30, 3:45, 4;00, 4:30 5:00 and over 5
	Similar for HM and 10K
	
2	Can we build a query that can check for how many runners in a particlar age category finished in a particular time
	For this we may have to build a interface
3	Top 100 runners by city with time
4	% of runners with negative splits acorss categories and rce distances
5	% of runners finishing within 4:30 hours for Marathon, 2:15 hours for HM and 1 hour for 10K
